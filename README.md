# discord-bot
This is the repository for the Discord Bot I am developing for private use.

This bot is running on a Google Cloud Compute Engine VM Instance on Debian.

This bot has minimal functionality, but the goal of setting this bot up is to gain more practice with:

1. Python
2. SQLite
3. Linux
4. GitHub
5. Google Cloud Platform

Note: 'key' file must be located in the root repo directory, containing solely the Discord Bot API key.
